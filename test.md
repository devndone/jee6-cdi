CDI has merit on its own outside of the EJB and JSF space. This<br>
tutorial only covers CDI. Repeat there is no JSF 2 or EJB 3.1 in this tutorial.<br>
There are plenty of articles and tutorials that cover using CDI as part of a larger <a href='http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjbnr.html'>JEE 6 application</a>.<br>
This tutorial is not that. This tutorial series is CDI and only CDI.<br>
