<b>About the author</b>
<br />
This article was written with CDI advocacy in mind by <a href='http://profiles.google.com/RichardHightower/about'>Rick Hightower</a> with some collaboration from others. Rick Hightower has worked as a CTO, Director of Development and a Developer for the last 20 years. He has been involved with J2EE since its inception. He worked at an EJB container company in 1999. He has been working with Java since 1996, and writing code professionally since 1990. Rick was an early <a href='http://java.sys-con.com/node/47735'>Spring enthusiast</a>. Rick enjoys bouncing back and forth between C, Python, Groovy and Java development. 
<p> 
Although not a fan of <a href='http://java.sys-con.com/node/216307'>EJB 3</a>, Rick is a big fan of the potential of CDI and thinks that EJB 3.1 has come a lot closer to the mark.
