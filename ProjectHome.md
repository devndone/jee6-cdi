You may wonder why this site and project exists.
CDI is a great technology.
CDI provides a standard way to do dependency injection and AOP.
CDI is part of JEE 6.

The aim of this project is to make the CDI examples easier to use so more people learn CDI, and to build a community around CDI development.

We believe that CDI is the future for Java developers.

[To run the examples and learn more about them go here.](GettingStarted.md)

We wrote a [comprehensive introduction, tutorial and cookbook to do DI with CDI](DependencyInjectionAnIntroductoryTutorial.md), it is in progress but already has 30 some pages.
